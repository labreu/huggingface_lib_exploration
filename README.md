# LLM Transformers Library Exploration

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of the Large Language Model (LLM) Transformers library, focusing on its setup, features, and practical applications for natural language processing tasks. This is intended for studies only.

Transformers have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by providing an architecture that excels in understanding and generating human languages. The `LLM Transformers` library builds on top of well-established frameworks such as Hugging Face's Transformers, offering enhanced capabilities and simplified interfaces for working with pre-trained models.

## Use Cases

LLM Transformers can be applied to a variety of NLP tasks such as:

- **Text Classification**
- **Summarization**
- **Question Answering**
- **Text Generation**

## Performance Optimization

To optimize the performance of the LLM Transformers models:

- **Use Mixed Precision Training**: Leverage tensor cores on modern GPUs.
- **Distributed Training**: Distribute the training process across multiple GPUs or machines.
- **Optimize Hyperparameters**: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and model architectures.
